# Introductions to Java Applications Input/Output and Operators.

Note: Syntax error also called compiler errors, compiler-time erros or compilation errors.

Note: It is important Write JavaDoc when begin the program, with the comments Author, Purpose of the program, date and time the program was last modified.

Note: The filename and the Class Name are same, to prevent compiler errors.

## Class Name and Indentifiers 
By convention, Class Names bigin with a capital letter and capitalize the first letter of each word they include.

A class name is an **identifier** a series of characters consisting of letter, digits, underscodes (_), and dollar $ signs,
that does not bigin with digit and does not contains spaces. 

## Class Body
**Important**
To make a group sets of expressions, together, they create what is known as a code block or code segment.

- Left brace: ```{```
- Right brace: ```}```

## Declaring a Method
The stating point of every Java Applications.

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
  System.out.println("Welcome to Java World!!");
  
} // end method main
```

Note: JVM (Java Virtual Machine) can translete the bytecode (.class) into instructions that are understood by the underlying operating system and hardware.
